		OK, real talk right now. Yoda conditions are ridiculous.
		The fundamental problem that Yoda conditions attempts to solve is:
		the equality operator is very close to the assignment operator.
		It's easy to mess up and accidentally assign to the variable you're
		trying to check.
		Here's the thing though. Yoda conditions just don't read correctly
		in the code flow. They require you to change the way you think
		about the control flow.
		Rather than forcing every conditional to be backwards, why not ban
		assignment from conditionals? You never really *need* to assign in
		a conditional.
		So, here's where I stand: no to Yoda conditions. Yes to banning
		assignment in conditionals.
		Thank you Human Made!
