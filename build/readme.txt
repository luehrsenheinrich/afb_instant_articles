== Description ==

The WordPress Instant Articles plugin creates a special RSS Feed for your WordPress blog to harvest the power of Facebook Instant Articles.

Instant Articles is a new technology by Facebook that will load your webpage content „instant“. That means Facebook will cache your articles on Facebooks servers and will load them within the native FB iOS or Android App without opening a browser window and connecting to your webserver.

This plugin is brought to you by the awesome folks at [WP Munich](http://www.wp-munich.com/?utm_source=plugin&utm_medium=plugin-repository-description&utm_campaign=afbia).

You can learn more about Instant Articles on the official [Facebook Developer Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles).

Instant Articles are available for all Publishers since [Facebook f8 Developer Conference](http://fbf8.com) in April 2016. [Please signup for the Instant Article Feature on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/instant_articles/signup) before you install the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

###I've updated a setting, but the change doesn't show on Facebook?
In order to preserver performance changing a setting in the backend - like updating the style variable, or the analytics settings - does not prompt the Facebook crawler to recrawl your articles. The only indicator to achieve this is the "last modified" date of the article itself. So if you need to propagate a change to instant articles you have to hit "save" on your articles to reset the last modified date.

###How can I help with the development of this plugin?
Head over to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/luehrsenheinrich/afb_instant_articles) and start reading. Every bit of help is highly appreciated!

###Where can I find the new RSS Feed created by this plugin?
The feed can be found at http://www.yourblogurl.com/feed/instant_articles/

###I like to track article impressions for my Instant Articles. How can I do that?
Copy and Paste your Google Analytics code in the „Analytics“ Area of the Plugin Settings.


###My Author Information is not linked to my Facebook Profile.
Please use the Yoast SEO Plugin to add this additional profile information to your WordPress user settings. <##= pkg.title ##> will use this information.

###Feature XYZ is not available! Why?
Keep calm. Development of this plugin will continue and we will add more features in the future!
If you are missing something special, please open a support ticket on wordpress.org.

###My feed has stopped working!
Usually this is due to performance reasons. If you use a lot of social media embeds the generation of the feed will be performance heavy, so you might try to reduce the number of posts shown in the Instant Articles feed.
